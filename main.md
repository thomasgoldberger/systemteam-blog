# The System Team - Curse or Blessing?

## Introduction

The System Team could be a mighty tool in your organization, if used correctly - if not it can be a massiv pain, not necessary for the organization or for the development teams. But for the System Team. Which could lead to losing qualified personal, knowledge maybe even DevOps culture.
I want to talk about what the System Team is, which role it can play in an organization as well as the most common pitfalls when "using" a System Team.

## The System Team

Often the System Team can be found in organization's that has multiple dev teams and/or are working in some kind of scaled agile framework. Often it's not called System Team, this terminology has been established by the scaled agile framework SAFe.  

But what is a System Team actually?

Well, to put it simple, it's a DevOps practice specialized team. A horizontal support and enabling team. The main focus of a System Team should be:

* building infrastructure for development, this could go as far as building the cloud infrastructure
* setting up build and deployment pipelines
* supporting with initial CI workflow, Git strategy as well as setting up workflows to
* integration of solutions in existing environments
* helping teams to setup system and solution demos
* end-to-end testing, if necessary
* supporting teams during releases

Let's look at SAFe's definition for the System Team:

> The System Team is a specialized Agile Team that assists in building and supporting the Agile development environment, typically including development and maintenance of the toolchain that supports the Continuous Delivery Pipeline.  The System Team may also support the integration of assets from Agile teams, perform end-to-end Solution testing where necessary, and assists with deployment and Release on Demand.
